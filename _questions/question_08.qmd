### Exercise 8: Communicating Your Results

You’ve now explored several ways to segment employees using clustering. 
In this final task, you’ll choose the clustering model you believe worked best, and write a 1–2 paragraph summary of your preferred clustering model and what it reveals about employee groups that would make sense to a business manager.

Your summary should be clear, concise, and insightful — not just a restatement of your code.

*Hints*:

- Use the "Write Like an Amazonian" tips from Group Assignment 1 to aid your writing. 
- You may need some extra code to get you towards the most actionable and manager friendly insights. Adapt the code you have so far to get what you need.
